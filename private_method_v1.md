## 🧹 Anti-Detection Rules
- Never play a perfect game (1+ inaccuracy/mistake always)
- Intentionally draw/lose after 6 straight wins
- Avoid puzzle grinding
- Write fake post-game reviews ("missed fork", "bad eval")
- Avoid dominating in variants (bullet, puzzle rush)
- Use strict move delays every move
- 80% rapid, 20% blitz ratio
- Use incognito, clear cookies often
- Play occasional garbage lines (unsound gambits)

## 🧠 Summary
```
✓ First 8 moves = book
✓ Delay per move = 3–7s
✓ 1 inaccuracy every 10–20 moves
✓ 1 mistake every 5–12 games
✓ 1 blunder every 6–20 games
✓ Max 60% win rate over 20 games
✓ Break every 5–6 games
✓ Reset IP every 30–100 games
✓ Fake logs, fake learning, fake notes
✓ Never win too fast, never dominate long
